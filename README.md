📘 CSES Problem Set — Java Solutions

A personal collection of my solutions to the CSES Problem Set, implemented in Java.
I am solving these problems to strengthen my fundamentals in:
  1. Algorithms
  2. Data Structures
  3. Competitive Programming
  4. Problem-solving skills
All solutions are written with clean code, efficiency, and readability in mind.


🚀 Goals

Solve all problems from the CSES Problem Set
Write optimized and well-structured Java solutions
Improve understanding of core algorithms like:
  1. DP (Dynamic Programming)
  2. Graph Theory (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
  3. Sorting & Searching
  4. Math & Number Theory
  5. Trees & Recursion
